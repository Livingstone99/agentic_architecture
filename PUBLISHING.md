### Step 1: Verify Package Locally

Already completed - dry-run successful!

```bash
cd /Users/victoremeka/agentic_architecture
dart pub publish --dry-run
```

**Result**: ✅ Package has 0 warnings

### Step 2: Set Up pub.dev Account

Before publishing, ensure you have:

1. **Google Account** - Required for pub.dev
2. **Verified Publisher** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to https://pub.dev/publishers
   - Create a verified publisher (e.g., victoremeka.dev)
   - Adds credibility and branding

### Step 3: Authenticate with pub.dev

```bash
dart pub login
```

This will:
- Open a browser
- Ask you to sign in with Google
- Grant publishing permissions

### Step 4: Create GitHub Repository

**IMPORTANT**: Before publishing, create the repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/victoremeka
2. Create new repository: `agentic_architecture`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we have one)

Then push the code:

```bash
cd /Users/victoremeka/agentic_architecture

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial release v0.1.0 - Production-ready agent architecture package"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/victoremeka/agentic_architecture.git

# Push to main
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Create release tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Version 0.1.0 - Initial release"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### Step 5: Publish to pub.dev

**Final publication command**:

```bash
cd /Users/victoremeka/agentic_architecture
dart pub publish
```

You'll see:
- Package validation
- Confirmation prompt
- Upload progress
- Success message with package URL

**Type 'y' when prompted to confirm publication.**

### Step 6: Verify Publication

3. Verify:
   - ✅ README displays properly
   - ✅ Example tab shows examples
   - ✅ Documentation is accessible
   - ✅ Versions shows 0.1.0
   - ✅ Changelog is visible

### Step 7: Test Installation

In a new Flutter project:

```bash
# Create test project
flutter create test_agentic_arch
cd test_agentic_arch

# Add package
flutter pub add agentic_architecture

# Verify it's in pubspec.yaml
cat pubspec.yaml | grep agentic_architecture
```

## ⚡ Super Quick Publish (TL;DR)

If you already have a GitHub account and are comfortable with git:

```bash
# 1. Create repo on GitHub (https://github.com/new)
# 2. Then run:

cd /Users/victoremeka/agentic_architecture
git init && git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial release v0.1.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/victoremeka/agentic_architecture.git

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Repository already exists"
You already created it. Just push:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/victoremeka/agentic_architecture.git
git push -u origin main
```

### "Authentication failed"
```bash
dart pub logout
dart pub login
# Try again
```

### "Package name already taken"
Change name in `pubspec.yaml` and file names. We chose a unique name, so this shouldn't happen!

### "Connection error"
